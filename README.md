## Welcome to [https://pegasusict.github.io/]

Hi, my name is Mattijs Snepvangers, I'm a software developer/IT analist from the Netherlands.

I'm programming in BASH & Python 3 since spring of 2017 and currently I have 2 projects online:

---

### PLAT - Pegasus' Linux Administration Tools [https://pegasusict.github.io/PLAT/] V1.0-beta
This codesuite is meant to deal with the everyday PostInstall & maintenance tasks every linux admin is familiar with.

 - [x] adding apt lines,
 - [x] apt-update/upgrade/autoremove/clean,
 - [x] garbage collection,
 - [x] creating backups,
 - [x] etc...

The suite is specifically tailored for use on Ubuntu derivatives, I'm not sure whether my scripts are LSB compliant.

### AMM - Audiophiles' Music Manager [https://pegasusict.github.io/AMM/] V0.0-alpha
This codesuite will be capable of:
- [ ] identifying files based on audio fingerprints
- [ ] telling files ( in numerous different file formats ) apart based on audiofingerprints and relative quality,
- [ ] retrieving missing information ( labels, albumart, lyrics, etc... )
- [ ] restructuring an audio collection based on tag information ( based on however the user chooses, of course... )
for the full list of functionality etc, Have a look at the project page.

Feedback is critical for me to evolve my software, so please tell me what can be improved upon!!!
